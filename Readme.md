## Tech Stack

- [golang](https://go.dev/) - just wanted to get try out a new language for me and golang has a low barrier to get started
- [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) - popular and with a lot of documentation. Why not.
- [templ](https://templ.guide/) - typesafe templates. Yes, I like type safety!
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/) - jump on the new hype train!
- postgreSQL - stable and established db with good services for a free tier. Don't need any fancy unproven stuff for the DB for now.
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - keept it to the standard since I'm not a frontend dev
